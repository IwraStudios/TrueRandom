# The Gravity.Random Library
Striving for as random as possible

The ways we try to achieve "as random as possible":

* using bytes for an theoretical infinite amount of numbers
* using time so it won't be constant
 * CPU's use Thread.Sleep inaccurately to save preformance; so we use it to our advantage
 
Roadmap (3/10/2016(dd/mm/yyyy)):
* Add v1.0 Release to github
  * debug/release binarys
  * source-code release
