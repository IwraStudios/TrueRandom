# The Gravity.Random Library
Striving for as random as possible

The ways we try to achieve "as random as possible":

* using bytes for an theoretical infinite amount of numbers
* using time so it won't be constant
 * CPU's use Thread.Sleep inaccurately to save preformance; so we use it to our advantage
 
Roadmap (2/10/2016(dd/mm/yyyy)):
* Make most functions and .net library refrences independent(for portable use)
  * Create new "Psuedo-random" algorithm 
  * Make own BitConverter/Convert library(not sure if needed)
